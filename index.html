              <p>With STOP 2.0 every bus stop has an iBeacon Bluetooth transmitter. The mobile app in the traveller's pocket recognizes the nearest bus stop via iBeacons. Then the application provides information about next departures from the stop. After that it's easy to send a request for the driver of your chosen bus to pick you up.</p>

              <p>When using STOP 2.0 there is no need to panic. Every bus has an iBeacon transmitter to identify the current bus the user is in. The stop destination can be chosen in advance so the child has plenty of time to choose and pick the stop where they want to get off.</p>

              <p>With STOP 2.0 tourists spend less time deciphering timetables and more time sightseeing, since getting off at the right stop is guaranteed. All the user has to do is wait for the notification which tells when the chosen bus is arriving at the correct stop.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>The existing public transport doesn't pay enough attention to different special needs groups such as the visually impaired, children or the elderly. We want Helsinki to be the city where the people can use public transport smoothly regardless of age or capability. Currently, it is very difficult for visually impaired people to get the right bus to stop, especially during rush hour or if the bus is late. On the other hand, children can easily panic if they are not familiar with the route and the info screen with stop names is missing or faulty.</p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>The main purpose of the STOP 2.0 is to allow the traveller to give information for the driver about their wish to stop the bus. The application uses small iBeacon Bluetooth transmitters for location. Both the buses and the stops have iBeacon transmitters, so the user is able to identify the beacon and ask the bus to stop on the right place: either from the bus stop for the approaching vehicle or from inside the bus. STOP 2.0 is integrated into buses to notify the driver about the need to stop at a certain bus stop.</p>

            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <h5>STOP 2.0 uses state of the art technology.</h5>
            <p>The mobile application is written in <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>. The back end server uses Python and <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> and is continuously deployed by <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-CI</a>.</p>
            <p>A more accurate description of the technical architecture can be found <a href="https://github.com/STOP2/stop2.0-documentation/wiki/System%20Architecture">here</a>.
